about: Ask for help in Discord or on the help repo instead - https://discord.gg/9C5f8B9

We only use this issue tracker for bugs in the library itself and feature requests for it.
We don't typically answer questions or help with support issues here.
Instead, please ask in one of the support channels in our Discord server or in the help reop:

https://discord.gg/9C5f8B9
https://github.com/discordts/help

Any issues that don't directly involve a bug in the library or a feature request will likely be closed.
